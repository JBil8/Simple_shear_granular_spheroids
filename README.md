# Simple Shear Project

This repository contains the code and configuration for running simulations of simple shear flow of spheroids, as part of a research project supporting the publication "*Shear flow of frictional spheroids: Comparison between elongated and flattened particles*" by Jacopo Bilotto, Martin Trulsson, and Jean-Fran√ßois Molinari [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1103/tj41-6qqk)].
The dataset generated from these simulations is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17140603).

## Project Overview

This project is designed to run simulations using the LIGGGHTS software for discrete element method (DEM) simulations of simple shear flow. It includes scripts for launching simulations, compiling the LIGGGHTS source code, and post-processing results. The project is configured to run on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster using SLURM, but it can also be adapted for local execution.

## Repository Structure

- **`launcher/`**: Contains scripts for launching simulations on the HPC cluster using SLURM.
- **`liggghts_source/`**: location where the LIGGGHTS source code will be cloned, compiled and installed .
- **`postprocessing/`**: Contains post-processing scripts and a `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies. `setup_ven.sh` automatically generates a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and installs dependencies.
- **`config.yaml`**: Configuration file specifying simulation parameters, sweep parameters, and SLURM settings.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`modules_used.txt`**: Lists required HPC modules and their versions for compiling and running LIGGGHTS.
- **`setup_env.sh`**: Script to automatically load required HPC modules.


## Prerequisites

### On an HPC Cluster
The project is configured to run on an HPC cluster with the modules (listed in `modules_used.txt`).
The file contains the specific versions used for this study. If they are not available on the local spack, they can be installed manually in a directory where you have permissions.
If you load modules with different versions, the program might still run, but the results could be different.

If the modules are present, they can be automatically loaded by running 
```bash
source setup_liggghts.sh
```
which loads the modules, clones the liggghts source code and automatically compiles it through `compiler.sh` using CMake with the correct flags

### On a Local Machine
If running locally, you need to install the above dependencies manually. Refer to the official documentation for each dependency to install compatible versions:

LIGGGHTS
CMake
Eigen
VTK
Python 3.11
Other dependencies (e.g., gcc, zlib-ng, bzip2, pkgconf)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure the Simulation
Edit the `config.yaml` file to set the desired parameters:

- **Simulation Data Directory**: Update the `sim_data_dir` field to specify where simulation data should be stored. For example:
  ```yaml
  sim_data_dir: "/path/to/your/storage/sim_data"
  ```
- **Email Notifications**: Update the mail_user field in the SLURM settings to receive job status notifications (e.g., BEGIN, END, FAIL):
```yaml
mail_user: "your.email@example.com"
```

- **Other Parameters**: The config.yaml file also includes:
    - executable: Path to the LIGGGHTS executable (/Liggghts_dev/build/liggghts).
    - input_script: LIGGGHTS input script (in.simple_shear_le).
    - simulation parameters: radius (1), density (1000).
    - wweep parameters: aspect_ratios, inertial_numbers, cofs (coefficients of friction).
    - SLURM settings: ntasks, cpus_per_task, mem, time, mail_type.

### 2. Run Simulations

Submit the SLURM jobs:
```bash
  bash launcher/parametric_study_launcher.sh
```

### 3. Post-Processing

Navigate to the `postprocessing/` directory and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
cd postprocessing
source setup_venv.sh
```

Run post-processing scripts with:
```bash
bash parallel_postprocessing_sbatch.sh
```
The data will appear in the `output_data_hertz/` directory.
